## Convert your Google Form into a One Click Submission
Do you hate clicks?  You've come to the right place.

### The before time:
1. You present your users a link to a form
2. The user opens the form
3. The user selects their options
4. The user clicks "Submit"

### The new way:
1. Present options as a link
2. The user clicks the link ðŸ¤¯

### An example:
At the end of your article or blog post, include a few links that allow the user to submit their feedback.

Keep in that you'll need to generate pre-filled links for each response, and convert each link to a one click URL.

> How did you enjoy this article?  [Great]() | [Good]() | [Fair]() | [Bad]()

In this example, each link is a one-click form submission, requiring no further action from the user.

### How to use?
You can [use the online app](https://jeffreywyman.github.io/one-click-google-form/) or [open a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X4xG1w7yLwAPTJH6ywIOVUoa1wZTorCCVXb92U8YBKE/copy) to easily convert multiple links.
